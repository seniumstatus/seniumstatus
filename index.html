[About]
\n
Senium is an American grunge band from Portland, Oregon.
\n
[Status]
	\n
Senium formed in 2004, disbanded (on hiatus) since 2023.

Current Lineup:
Andrew McNicholas - guitar, vocals, bass guitar (2004-now)

Past members:
Mark Tarquinio - Drums (2011-2015)
Jesse Wirtz - Bass (2013-2015)
Garin Rosen - drums (2021-2023)

As of 2023 this was the bands status, as of July 2024 the band had removed their two albums Flying Machine (2022) and Senium (2019) from all streaming platforms, including Bandcamp.

In October-November 2024 the band had removed every other album, except their debut album, "Such Progress" (2011). 
The band is assumed to be completely disbanded, with Andrew McNicholas also quitting.

[Status/Socials]

On February 8th 2024, assumed to be just Andrew posted on the bands Facebook "You better believe we are working on a new album.", that album never happened.
There seems to be no hints of this album. 

On May 8th 2024, Steve Albini who mixed and mastered their album "Such Progress" (2011) died. We have no truthful info but we assume he remastered it in 2021 for its 10 year anniversary.

Senium has stopped responding to emails via Bandcamp and seniumcontact@gmail.com

Some info about Seniums "Flying Machine" (2022) and "Senium" (2019) from March 4th 2022 was found on https://makeit-loud.com/2022/03/04/senium-senium/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1vktqeZPco3-S4fWGiz72XHZ82v9sWat60PZGO9HfKdJ2ql-Un0ofVrMk_aem_p8unLq8jToYc2LDfnnH35w

"On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia detected in Wuhan, China.  Ever since then the year 2019 has been defined by COVID-19.  Which is a bit of a shame, because on September 18th that year a band called Senium, released their fourth studio album.  So what, I hear you cry, the world was paralysed by a pandemic. 

Well, it turns out that Senium are a big deal.  Their music is classic grunge rock, but it also hits you harder than a prize fighter wielding a wrecking ball.  Read reviews of Senium’s work and you’ll see plenty of references to Nirvana.  It’s a good comparison, but there’s more to this band. 

Hailing from New Jersey, these guys seem to be on the wrong coast for grunge music.  However, they’re not so much following in the footsteps of previous grunge acts, they’re stomping their own boot marks in to the ground. 

Andrew McNicholas has a vocal style all of his own.  He’s part countertenor and part Geddy Lee.  The guitar hooks on Senium’s self-titled fourth album are tastier than a New Jersey pizza, and the fuzz and distortion will have you forming your own mosh pit in the living room.  The Drop-D style tuning and the heavy bass are exquisite (check out the intro to ‘That Does It’), whilst the beats are the catchiest you’ve heard since you last listened to ZZ Top’s ‘Tres Hombres’ album.

Music offers a unique respite for the human mind, so go grab your plaid flannel shirt, crank up the subwoofer and slam dance your way in to the weekend with Senium.  Oh, and if you want more, the fifth studio album ‘Flying Machines’ will be out this Spring."

On Facebook (May 8, 2024) Senium posted:
"RIP Steve Albini, we love you and thank you so much for recording our favorite albums and recording our first album Such Progress. We will never forget that experience and we will never forget how great of a guy you were."

On May 30th 2024 Senium changed their Facebook profile picture to the picture for their single "I'll Go On", the 8th track from their album "Out of Range" (2015), about 8 years, 11 months and 28 days after the release of the "Out of Range" (2015) album.

On March 9th 2015, 2 months before the band released "Out of Range" (2015), the band posted "Senium "Save you from myself" video live at Costa mesa studios (HD)" to Youtube, which most people assume was their last live show. Since then they've posted a video for "I'll Go On" (January 17, 2018), and a full album video for "Such Progress" (March 11, 2023).

"Out of Range" (May 20, 2015)
Couldn't find much info on this album. The only info we have is from discogs.com, "Limited to 100 digipaks signed by the band. MP3/Flac download included.".
It seems the album was available to purchase for Digipak and CD, probably MP3/WAV file too.

"Senium" (2019)
No second hand info for this. A 12 song album, used to be purchased (was limited) via CD, you could also have purchased a 320kbps MP3 file version of the album.

"Flying Machine" (2022)
No second hand info for this. Was only available to buy on Bandcamp, 11 song 320kpbs MP3/WAV/Flac file album.

All of Senium's albums were self released and were not on a label.

-----------------------------------------------

That is all for this band and their discography, it was very weird they just disappeared off the surface of the earth with no notice and fans hoping for a new album to be released in 2024-2025.
